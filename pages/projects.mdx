            description: "EzMediaCore is a Bukkit library written in Java with the purpose of providing a simple and easy way to render media on a Minecraft server. One of the most fascinating features of EzMediaCore is the ability to render videos on a Bukkit server. External video playback libraries such as FFmpeg or VLC Media Player are used to aid in frame rendering. Dithering algorithms are included in the library to provide a smooth and high-quality video playback experience in-game. With the power of these tools, we're able to play not just standard Youtube videos, but live-streams, screen-shares, webcams, and other input devices, reaching extremely high frame rates with limited bandwidth constraints.",

Besides rendering websites, it's able to support playback from videos, files, etc. on the internet. Since Neon uses Selenium, the plugin is able to load web pages at blazing fast speeds. Neon was heavily inspired by my EzMediaCore library, which was a plugin that was able to play videos from the internet. It took advantage of playback using VLC Media Player, FFmpeg, and YoutubeDL, but the code base became too complex and I wanted to divert to a project that is more general. That's when I had the idea of websites.",
